# Weissman score calculator

This repository contains a Python module to compute the Weissman Score of a
compression algorithm.

The Weissman Score is a fictional performance score for lossless data compression
algorithms devised by Tsachy Weissman and Vinith Misra at Stanford University
and used in the HBO comedy series *Silicon Valley*.

The Weissman score W is computed as:

W = alpha \* r/r<sub>b</sub> \* log(T<sub>b</sub>)/log(T)

where *r* and *T* refer to the compression ratio and time-to-compress
of the target algorithm, *r<sub>b</sub>* and *T<sub>b</sub>* refer to same quantities for a
standard universal compressor (this implementation uses gzip) and
*alpha* is a scaling constant.

## Usage

You can run the script as follows:

    python weissman.py -c <command> -i <input> -o <output> -a <alpha> -r <reps>

Where:

* `command` is the command to launch the target compression algorithm and compress a specific `input` file into the `output` file. This command must keep the original (uncompressed) file
* `input` is the path to the uncompressed file used in the test
* `output` is the path to the compressed file generated by `command`
* `alpha` is the scaling parameter of the Weissman score
* `reps` is the number of times the experiment needs to be repeated (mean values are taken to compute the score)

A trivial usage example to compute bzip score is:

    python weissman.py -c "bzip2 --keep README.md" -i README.md -o README.md.bz2 -a 1.0 -r 5

This code can also be used within a Python program:

    >>> import weissman
    >>> weissman.weissman("bzip2 --keep README.md", "README.md", "README.md.bz2", alpha=1.0, reps=5)
